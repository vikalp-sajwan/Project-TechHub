                <h2>Motorola Moto Turbo With 5.2-Inch QHD Display Launched</h2>
                <time datetime="2015-03-8">8 March, 2015</time>
                <img src="images/turbo.jpg">
                <p>Motorola India over the weekend teased the launch of the Motorola Moto Turbo in the country, and now, Flipkart on Monday has started taking pre-orders for the smartphone, which is priced at Rs. 41,999. The Flipkart page notes that the smartphone will be released in the third week of March.
The online retailer is also giving away launch day offers such as 100 percent cashback for 25 consumers and extra 10 percent off on the handset if purchased with American Express Cards. Notably, both the offers are only valid for Monday.</p>

<p>The Motorola Moto Turbo is a new variant of the Motorola Moto Maxx, which is the global variant of the Motorola Droid Turbo that is exclusive to US mobile carrier Verizon. Back in February, Flipkart teased the launch of the high-end Moto Turbo on Flipkart without revealing more details about the handset.</p>



<p>Going by Flipkart's listing of the Moto Turbo, the handset comes with identical specifications as the Moto Maxx. It also sports two material builds - Ballistic Nylon and Kevlar Fibre on the rear.


    The new Motorola Moto Turbo comes with some top-notch specifications, such as a QHD display - which has been seen on smartphones such as LG G3 and Samsung Galaxy Note 4, and is perhaps the highlight of the device. It features a 5.2-inch QHD (1440x2560 pixels) AMOLED display offering a pixel density of 565ppi, much higher than the 5.5-inch LG G3 at 534ppi and 5.7-inch Galaxy Note 4 at 515ppi. The screen also includes a Corning Gorilla Glass 3 protective layer.</p>



<p>It features a massive 3900mAh battery, the biggest amongst most high-end phones such as Sony Xperia Z3, Samsung Galaxy S6, Samsung Galaxy Note 4, and even Moto X (Gen 2). The company notes that the smartphone can deliver up to 48 hours of mixed usage. The Moto Turbo also supports Motorola's Turbo Charger, a new accessory from the company stables that is said to provide 7 hours of battery life in just 15 minutes of charging.

The smartphone is powered by a quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 805 processor clocked at 2.7GHz coupled with an Adreno 420 GPU and 3GB of RAM.<p>



<p>The Motorola Moto Turbo sports a 21-megapixel rear autofocus camera with f/2.0 aperture and dual-LED flash. The rear camera comes with features such as slow motion video; burst mode; auto HDR; Panorama, and tap to focus. Meanwhile, it can also record 4K videos at 24fps. It includes a 2-megapixel front camera. The Android 5.0 Lollipop-based Moto Turbo features water-repellent nano-coating. It measures 143.5x73.3x8.3mm and weighs 166 grams.

Connectivity options on the Moto Turbo include 4G LTE with LTE Cat. 4, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, Micro-USB, and GSM/ EDGE/ HSPA+. The smartphone comes only in one storage variant - 64GB.</p>
